I developed Workiez to connect people with the right help, simplifying task outsourcing in a streamlined platform. Here’s how it works:

👥 Two Types of Users:

Normal User 🧑‍💼: Posts a job they need done, views applications, and approves the best fit.
Worker User 🛠️: Browses jobs, applies to tasks that match their skills, and gets selected to complete the work.
🌍 Location-based Filters: Jobs can be filtered by district and province, making it easy to find the right local opportunities.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: Angular, served with NGINX
Backend: Spring Boot API
Deployment: Dockerized and deployed on a Kubernetes Minikube cluster using port forwarding for easy access 🚢
This project taught me a lot about full-stack development, Kubernetes deployment, and handling multi-user workflows. Looking forward to feedback and suggestions! 👨‍💻

It was great project that it could allowed me to learn about docker, k8s and more advanced devOps concepts🚀✨
